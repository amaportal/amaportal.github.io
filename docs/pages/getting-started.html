	<p>
		All requests to the API must be sent to <code>http://amaportalapi.besaba.com/api/</code>
	</p> <br>

	<p>
		Currently, <code>GET</code> requests sent to the API do not need any security tokens attached. 
		On the other hand, <code>POST</code> requests would require an <code>access_token</code> attached in every requests to ensure security and reliability. 
		Your app may acquire this token upon your client's login through Oauth2 authentication. You may save the <code>access_token</code> in a PHP Session for later use.
	</p> <br>

	<p>
		All reponse from the API will be in JSON format.
	</p> <br>

	<p>
		On the left side is a menu containing the list of currently availabe API on this portal. Select an API to find out more information in using and accessing each one of them.
